My name is Manuel Cerón. I’m a Software developer from Colombia living in The Netherlands. Currently working at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
I like to write about programming and programming languages. This website is written mostly in English, but there are some posts in Spanish too, my native
language.
