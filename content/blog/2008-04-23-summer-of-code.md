I’m participating in the Google’s Summer of Code of this year! I was selected for the Mono Project. I’m going to work on a Visual XAML Editor for Moonlight called Lunar Eclipse. LE [was started](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Aug-31.html) months ago  [Alan McGovern](http://monotorrent.blogspot.com/) (from MonoTorrent). My work is to improve it and make it shine!. My mentor is the famous [Miguel de Icaza](http://tirania.org/)

This is going to be a hell of a fun summer!
