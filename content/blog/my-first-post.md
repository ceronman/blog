Well, I have decided to start a web log. I will write it entirely in english, so if you see some grammatical errors or something like that, it is because my native language is spanish. I am writing in english because I want to improve my skills in that language.

 Now, let me talk about me and this web log. I am a student of Systems Engineering at the [University of Cauca](http://www.unicauca.edu.co/) in Colombia. I like a lot to work and play with computers. I am an enthusiastic of the [Free Software Movement](http://www.gnu.org/) and the [Open Source Movemet](http://www.opensource.org/), and I am an official member of the [GNU/Linux Users Group of the University of Cauca (GLUC).](http://gluc.unicauca.edu.co/) I love computer programming, specially, graphics and video-games programming. So this blog will be about all that stuff.

And that is all for now. I hope that I can write almost every day in this web log.
