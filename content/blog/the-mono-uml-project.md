These days I have looked at [mono-hispano.org](http://www.monohispano.org/). This is a community of followers of [The Mono Project](http://www.go-mono.org/), who speak spanish. One of their projects called much my atention: [The MonoUML Project](http://monouml.sourceforge.net/). Time ago, I was thinking in working on a free UML CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tool for GNU/Linux and [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/). I tried to understand the Gaphor project, but I really wanted to do something with the Mono Platform. So, when I saw the MonoUML Project, I thought that is just what I was looking for. So I decided to join the MonoUML team and start working on this tool. Last night I downloaded the last CVS tree and today i’m reading the documentation. Well, we are going to see how is goes to me with this…
