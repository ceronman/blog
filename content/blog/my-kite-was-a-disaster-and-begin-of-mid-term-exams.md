Today was the Free Software Kite Contest of which I spoke yesterday. My Python Kite was a disaster, did not fly!. The winner of the higher kite was one with a cool Mozilla Logo painted over it, and the winner of the most creative kite was one with a beautiful pyramid design with a lot of Free Software and Open Source logos. I hope I can do a better work next year…

Oh no! Tomorow will begin the mid-term exams at the university. I start with a Computational Theory exam. I am studying hard for it. I hope to be able to respond well tomorrow. We will see…
