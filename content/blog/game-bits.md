### Making an Indie MMO

 I found the [video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1057787544886461551&hl=en) of [Daniel James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_James)‘s presentation for the Game Developers Conference Independant Game Summit. Very interesting. I’m impressed to see how [Puzzle Pirates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Pirates) was made by only six people. There are also various interesting tips for MMO developers out there.

### Igda scholarships

[Igda](http://www.igda.org/) will award 25 [scholarships](http://www.igda.org/scholarships/) for the Game Developer Conference 2007. It will be in San Francisco on February 18-22.

### Open Liero

[Liero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liero) was one of my favorite freeware games of all times. I was very pleased to see that there is an [open source implementation](http://open.liero.be/) around similar to what [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org/) is for [Transport Tycoon Deluxe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon).

### Urban Terror

 These days, I can be found playing [Urban Terror](http://www.urbanterror.net/), a tactical like Counter Strike. Urban Terror is based on Quake III Arena and is completely open source. My nick name is Kira. Yes is because of [Death Note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note).
