Last week I went to Lima (PerÃº) to attend [Involucrate+GNOME](http://www.involucrate.org/2008/3/). I really had a good time. Special Thanks to [Diego](http://blogs.gnome.org/diegoe/), who invited me. Of course, Iâ€™ve got everything what Iâ€™ve seen in peruvian tv for years and never had the opportunity to taste. Inca-Cola, Chicha Morada, Cremolada, etc. I also verified that no one can eat a Margarita cookie as a normal cookie, leafs must be eaten first ðŸ˜›
