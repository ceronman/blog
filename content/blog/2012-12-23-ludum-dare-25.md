Last week I participated in [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/), one of the most popular game making competitions out there. The idea is to write a game in 48 hours. You have to create **everything** in those 48 hours. That includes graphics, sounds and code. This time the theme was ‚Äúyou are the villian‚Äù. I tried to participate before but failed to finish something. This time my primary goal was to finish a game, even if it was very simple.I decided to write [something](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=4896) between Space Invaders and Galaxian, where you actually played the aliens. I also decided to mix some tower defence elements. I had a lot of fun writing this game, even when in the end it was boring and buggy. Next time it will be better for sure.

For the game code I used [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/) and [a very immature library I‚Äôve been working on](https://github.com/ceronman/dartcocos). The result wasn‚Äôt very good. The controls were poor and the game is not very fun. It also has some ugly bugs. Writing a game in 48 hours is really hard; more than I initially thought. I was new with these tools and that made everything harder too. For graphics I used [The Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/).

Here is a bit summary of my experience.

**What went right:**

*   I finished! That‚Äôs the best thing!
*   I made something **simple**.
*   I started using very simple graphics and decided to improve them later only if there was time.
*   I could come up with a design pretty quickly, this allowed me to spend more time on coding and creating graphics.
*   I created a simple plan and was able to follow it on time.

**What went wrong**

*   Game mechanics and controls. The controls didn‚Äôt fit quite right with the game. The game mechanics could have been improved.
*   No sound üò¶ I didn‚Äôt have time for it.
*   Final game had some bugs because I tweaked the controls at the last minute.
*   I had bugs with other browsers that I didn‚Äôt detect until the last minute.
*   Sunday was significantly less productive than Saturday and Friday night. I was really tired and took a lot of breaks. Probably because I had a lot of work the previous week. I will try to take a rest before the compo next time.
*   I‚Äôm not an expert with the tools. That slowed me down with the code. And the engine I wrote is still very immature.

**What I learned**

*   Playing and rating games is equally or even more fun than writing the game. I love to see such explosion of creativity!
*   The community rocks! Thanks for everything.

Ludum Dare was an incredible fun experience. I won‚Äôt miss the next one!
