Tomorrow, I’m going to participate in the fifth edition of [PyWeek](http://www.pyweek.org/). PyWeek is a challenge in which participants must develop a video game in one week using [Python](http://www.python.org/). I like the idea because it brings a possibility to finish a project and have some fun by the way.

Some of the games created during PyWeek are really awesome. It’s amazing the fact that they were made in only one week. My favorite games of previous editions of PyWeek are:

*   [Nelly’s Rooftop Garden](http://pyweek.org/e/rushed/)
*   [The Olde Battleaxe 4](http://pyweek.org/e/toba4/)
*   [PyBlockTower](http://www.pyweek.org/e/GOD/)

I also like the competition and challenge [feeling](http://www.pyweek.org/d/956/) that you can breath in PyWeek.

It’s possible to participate in two categories: Individual and Team. This time I am going to participate as Individual. I am thinking in using [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/) only. Even when some people are talking about [Panda3D](http://www.panda3d.org/). I also want to use [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) to create pre-rendered sprites. I have been learning it secretly for a while. The result has been exactly what I expected: I suck as a graphic artist. My models are absolutely ugly, but at least I can do something for a game. By the way, now I prefer Blender to [Wings3D](http://www.wings3d.com/) for 3D modelling.

Screenshots of my attempt to model an aircraft with Blender. I also tried some kind of cell-shading or toon-shading redering:

If I suck with Blender. I prefer not even talk about my talent with sounds and music.

See you in one (py)week!
