Yesterday I am back from the [II Congreso Internacional de Software Libre](http://congreso.intep.edu.co/). It was just great!!!!!! I meet a lot of people from the Free Software and Open Source community of Colombia. There were many people from different locations of the country: Ipiales, [Pasto](http://lgt.udenar.edu.co/), [Popayán](http://gluc.unicauca.edu.co/), Guapi, Cali, [Roldanillo](http://www.intep.edu.co/masinfor.php), Tulua, Manizales, [Medellín](http://www.gigax.org/), Bogotá, [Villavicencio](http://guba.gsol.ws/), and others. I meet personally all people with who I speak by [IRC](http://www.freenode.net/). My speech of Mono was good too, very much people congratulate me for it.

Roldanillo is a very nice town, when i was a kid i lived there for a few years. It was 14 years since my last visit to there. Now, when i came back, i remembered a lot of things and places, it was a very nice experience. I love Roldanillo!!!

Here in my town, Popayán, and after the congress , I am very enthusiastic with free software. I will work hard for the [monouml project](http://monouml.sf.net/), and the adaptation to the gtk# tutorial.
