These days I am translating and adapting the PyGTK tutorial to GTK#. This job is a little bit complicated due to the DocBook XML sources. The good part of this is that let me learn a lot of things about GTK#, it is a good self-learning exercise, and, of course, it is a little contribution to the Free and Open Source Software Community.

I am thinking in participate in a [OpenGL ES](http://www.khronos.org/opengles/index.html)[contest](http://www.khronos.org/devu/opengles_challenge/) organized by [The Kronos Group](http://www.khronos.org/). Maybe it is a good opportunity for get back to the road of Game Development and Computer Graphics, one of my passions with the Free Software.
