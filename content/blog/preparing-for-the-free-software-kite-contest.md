Tomorrow will be the Free Software Kite Contest organized by the GLUC (GNU/Linux Users Group of University of Cauca). There are basically two categories: The most creative kite, using Free and Open Source Software logos, of course, and the longest or highest kite. The rules say that the kites must be built by hand, bought kites are not allowed. Today I bought the material for build my kite. It is going to be like a basic kite with diamond shape, and it will have the Python logo. I hope that i can build it before tomorrow.

By other side, I have my first homework for the MonoUML Project. I must to implement the `MonoUML.Widget.UML2.Class` class. I am working on that just right nowâ€¦
