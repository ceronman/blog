PyWeek is finished. Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time for it this year, so I’m almost a DNF. The theme for this year was _Robot_. My idea ended up being more like an application than a game. I wanted to create an educational environment for teaching programing to children. Something similar to Logo. The idea was to build a game where your could program a small robot. It should be interactive so children could experiment on the fly.

In other words, It should be something like this: A window with a robot and a world, bellow a Python console. The users should be able to write commands in the console and the robot should execute them. The robot should be able to interact with it’s environment and with the user too. Error, warnings, etc, should be given to the programmer in a friendly way. Additionally, there should be various challenges that the programmers should solve. This should be the fun factor for the game.

But, unfortunately, as I said before, I didn’t have more that a couple of hours every day since Thursday, so I’ve failed on most of my objectives, and the only thing I have is a barely working demo. No challenges, no fun, no objects, no cool environment. Any way, I still like the idea, and I will try to continue with this project. I would love to hear more opinions about it.

My final submission was called “PyBotLearn”. You can download it from  [PyWeek 6 Entry Page](http://www.pyweek.org/e/ceronman_return/).

Here is a small video of the demo:
